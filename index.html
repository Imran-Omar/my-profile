  <h2>May the force be with you</h2>
  <p>I'm a <strong>big fan of movies</strong>. I go to the movies at least <strong>once a week</strong>. Often with friends or family. My favorite genres are action films, comedies or thrillers. But my favorite saga by far is <strong>Star Wars</strong>. And my favorite characters are Master Yoda and <strong>Master Winduw</strong>. That's why I decided to make my website with a slightly purple color.</p>

  <h2>"Chez Sami" is the best restaurant of Europe !</h2>
  <p>I'm at least as much a fan of movies as I am of cooking. I love going to restaurants! My favourite food is <strong>Indian food</strong>, but I also love <strong>French</strong> and <strong>Arabic food</strong>. <strong>Lebanese</strong> cuisine is also one of my favorites.
  The restaurant that is for me a favorite is called "<strong>Chez Sami</strong>" it is located in Geneva and the food is really good.
  You can book a table if you trust me by clicking on the button below.
  Enjoy your meal!

  <h2>Who is stronger than Pirlo ?</h2>
  <p>Other than cooking and Star Wars, I'm a <strong>big football fan</strong>. I've been playing it for so long that I can't remember when I started. Probably when I was four or five years old. I played in clubs for 6 years between the ages of 11 and 17. And I always watched a lot of games on TV. I don't have a favorite team, what I like is the <strong>beautiful game</strong>. And the player who symbolises the most what I like is Pirlo. His way of playing was almost <strong>magical</strong> for me.</p>
